excerpt: A neat visualisation of our local cosmic environment
---

I found this neat visualisation on the [Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal](https://asaip.psu.edu/). It's difficult to discern the topology of our local cosmic environment through 2D plots alone, but without context 3D visualisations can be just as confusing and unwieldy. The authors of this video do a really great job in revealing how the local universe fits together, providing the necessary context behind these fantastic 3D visualisations.
