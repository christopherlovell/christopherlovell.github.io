excerpt: R gist for converting m3u playlists in to JSON
---

I have tens of playlists from my pre-spotify days locked inside my old mediamonkey installation that I'd quite like to liberate (I have grand plans to publish them here some day), but they're all in a horrible format called m3u. JSON is much prettier, so I wrote an R script that converts m3u to JSON. Some of the Regex isn't pretty, but it works.
