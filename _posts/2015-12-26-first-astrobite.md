excerpt: For Christmas, I gave the world my first ever Astrobite
---

During my undergraduate I often read a site called Astrobites, which aims to bring front line research in Astronomy and Astrophysics to undergraduates via short, accessible articles written by graduate students. When I started my Ph.D I noticed that they were advertising for new writers and promptly applied. As part of the application I wrote a post about the EAGLE simulation, which I've started working on . I was fortunate enough to be accepted, and immediately given the date for my first post: Christmas Day. After some feedback from other Astrobite editors, and a little frantic Christmas Eve editing, I managed to publish it on time. It's about an observational paper that came out this summer that claims to have glimpsed the light from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01734" target="_blank">first generation of stars</a>. I'm admittedly pretty proud of it; I didn't even consider the possibility of contributing to this site when doing my undergraduate. I actually ended up learning a lot too; it's interesting how much extra attention you pay when you are responsible for teaching others (or just afraid of being called out).
