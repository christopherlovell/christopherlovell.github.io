When did the first passive galaxies emerge?
Passsive galaxies are common in the local Universe, but at high redshifts they are much rarer; understanding what leads to quiescence in the early Universe is key to understanding the processes leading to passivity at all times {% cite santini_emergence_2021 %}.

In {% cite lovell_first_2023 %} we studied the passive population in [FLARES](projects/flares). 
Due to the unique FLARES approach we can study very rare populations of galaxies at high redshift, and found passive populations of galaxies out to redshifts of 7-8.
This passivity is due to AGN feedback in the EAGLE model.

A number of passive galaxies have now been detected at these early times, and FLARES is being used to understand these objects {% cite long_efficient_2023 %}.
