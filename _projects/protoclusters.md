Protoclusters are the pre-collapse descendants of massive galaxy clusters.
In my first paper I explored the sizes and shapes of these objects, and methods for their characterisation and detection {% cite lovell_characterising_2018 %}.

I have also worked with colleagues to explore other aspects of protocluster evolution and detection {% cite chen_almacal_2023 %}, and more generally the impact of environment on galaxy evolution in the FLARES project {% cite lovell_first_2021 %}.
