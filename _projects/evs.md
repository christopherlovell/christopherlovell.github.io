Extreme Value Statistics is a branch of statistics concerned with the most extreme deviations from a given distribution.
In {% cite lovell_extreme_2023 %} we used EVS to predict the most massive haloes and galaxies in the high redshift Universe.
We found tension with some of the earliest JWST results, but over time those tensions have diminished as the calibration has improved, redshift outliers have been identified, and stellar mass estimates have been refined.

The EVS technique is now being used to evaluate candidates from Euclid and other observatories {% cite franco_unveiling_2023 %}.
Christian Kragh Jespersen, a student at Princeton, has also worked on including the effects of cosmic variance in an EVS-like scheme, finding important deviations from the fiducial results for individual JWST pointings {% cite kragh_jespersen_significance_2024 %}.
