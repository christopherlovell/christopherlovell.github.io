Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs), also known as Sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), are a rare population of dusty galaxies with incredibly high star formation rates {% cite wilkins_dust-obscured_2018 %}, leading to string emission in the FIR - sub-mm.
Predicting them in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations has been a challenge for a number of years, but we presented one of the best matches to date from the Simba simulation {% cite lovell_reproducing_2021 %}, using the Powderday dust radiative transfer code {% cite narayanan_powderday_2021 %}.
We also explored the dependence of the FIR-submm emission on orientation, and found interesting dependencies on inclination {% cite lovell_orientation_2022 %}.

I'm now part of the wider [AtLAST project](https://www.atlast.uio.no/), exploring how this proposed large single-dish observatory could revolutionise the study of DSFGs / SMGs {% cite van_kampen_atacama_2024 %}.
