Hello! I'm a computational astrophysicist working at the .

The focus of my research is galaxy formation and evolution.
I seek to understand how various physical processes shape galaxies, and lead to the diversity of the galaxy population.
A particular focus of my research has been the formation of the first galaxies, in the first billion years of the Universe's history.

To do this I use numerical simulations to model these physical processes, including their electromagnetic emission, allowing us to directly compare with the results from observational facilities.
I also employ deep learning techniques to accelerate these simulations, and provide novel insights.
Recently I have become interested in simulation based inference approaches, which allow us to use our sophisticated simulations to place direct constraints on key astrophysical parameters.
