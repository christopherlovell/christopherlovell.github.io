I am a computational astrophysicist studying how galaxies form and evolve.

My research focuses on the physical processes that shape galaxies and drive their diversity across cosmic time.
A major theme is understanding the earliest galaxies, in the first billion years of the Universe, now observed in detail by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb).

I use numerical simulations, forward modelling, and machine learning methods to connect theory with observations.
This includes synthetic observables, deep-learning accelerators for simulation workflows, and simulation-based inference to place direct constraints on astrophysical parameters.

I am a member of the [FLARES](https://flaresimulations.github.io/), [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid), [Learning the Universe](https://learning-the-universe.org/), and [CAMELS](https://www.camel-simulations.org/) collaborations.
