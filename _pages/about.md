Hello! I'm a computational astrophysicist studying how galaxies form and evolve. 

My research seeks to understand the various physical processes that shape galaxies, and leads to the diversity of the galaxy population we observe.
A particular focus of my research has been the formation of the first galaxies, in the first billion years of the Universe's history, now being probed in exquisite detail by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb).

To do this I use numerical simulations to model these complex physical processes, including their electromagnetic emission, allowing us to directly compare with the observed galaxy populations.
I also employ deep learning techniques to accelerate these simulations, and provide novel insights.
Recently I have become interested in simulation based inference approaches, which allow us to use our sophisticated simulations to place direct constraints on key astrophysical parameters.

I am a member of the [FLARES](flaresimulations.github.io/), [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid), [Learning the Universe](https://learning-the-universe.org/) and [CAMELS](https://www.camel-simulations.org/) collaborations. Please check out my [projects page](/projects) for a flavour of my current work.
