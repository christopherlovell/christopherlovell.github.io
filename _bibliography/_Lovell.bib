	abstract = {The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at \$5 {\textbackslash}lesssim z {\textbackslash}lesssim 10\$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass (\$m\_\{seed\} {\textbackslash}approx 1.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) while primary SMBHs span up to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, resulting in mass ratios from \$q {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ to \$1\$, with a peak at \$q {\textbackslash}sim 1\$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as \$n\_\{merger\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3.80\} (1 + {\textbackslash}delta){\textasciicircum}\{4.56\}\$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} {\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{tot\} / M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ and \$q {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, corresponding to a detection rate of 0.030 \$yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio \$SNR {\textbackslash}geq 10\$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.},

	abstract = {One of the most remarkable results from the {\textbackslash}emph\{James Webb Space Telescope\} has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H\$α\$ emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.{\textasciitilde}black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling {\textbackslash}flares{\textbackslash} with the {\textbackslash}qsosed{\textbackslash} model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift (\$z{\textgreater}5\$) AGN. To model the observed broad H\$α\$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, {\textbackslash}flares{\textbackslash} is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H\$α\$ luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at \$z=5\$.},

	abstract = {The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and, possibly host dark matter halo mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}\$, appear as the galactic properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker) correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sph\}\$, as also corroborated by additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in the residuals, although they tend to either favour \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sph\}\$ as the most fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high in \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.},

	abstract = {The spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST's NIRCam instrument has revolutionised our ability to probe the internal structure of early galaxies. By leveraging deep medium-band imaging in the Jades Origins Field, we assemble comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using 19 photometric bands for over 200 high-redshift galaxies (\$z {\textbackslash}geq 4.5\$). We present an analysis of this sample with particular emphasis on investigating the "outshining" phenomenon, which can bias the inferred stellar populations by masking the presence of evolved stellar populations (\${\textbackslash}geq\$ 100 Myr) with the light of bright, young O and B-type stars. We address this problem by performing spatially-resolved SED-fitting of both binned and full pixel-by-pixel photometry, which we compare to the traditional integrated approach. We find evidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies (\${\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor of 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5, depending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass offset correlates with burstiness (SFR\$\_\{10 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm Myr\}\$/SFR\$\_\{100 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm Myr\}\$) and sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass offsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar masses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models, although no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an outshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at \$z=7\$, finding little impact within the uncertainties. We conclude that outshining can be important in individual low-mass galaxies, but the overall impact is limited and should be considered alongside other systematic SED fitting effects.},

A number of recent measurements of very large galaxy stellar masses at high redshift (z {\textgreater} 8) motivate an investigation into whether any of these objects are in tension with ΛCDM. We use extreme value statistics to generate confidence regions in the mass-redshift plane for the most extreme mass haloes and galaxies. Tests against numerical models show no tension, neither in their dark matter halo masses nor their galaxy stellar masses. However, we find tentative {\textgreater}3σ tension with recent observational determinations of galaxy masses at high redshift from both Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, despite using conservative estimates for the stellar fraction (f⋆ {\textasciitilde} 1).

	abstract = {Substantial populations of massive quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 challenge our understanding of rapid galaxy growth and quenching over short timescales. In order to piece together this evolutionary puzzle, more statistical samples of these objects are required. Established techniques for identifying massive quiescent galaxies are increasingly inefficient and unconstrained at z {\textgreater} 3. As a result, studies report that as much as 70\% of quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3 may be missed from existing surveys. In this work, we propose a new empirical color selection technique designed to select massive quiescent galaxies at 3 ≲ z ≲ 6 using JWST NIRCam imaging data. We use empirically constrained galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates to define a region in the F277W ‑ F444W versus F150W ‑ F277W color plane that captures quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3. We apply these color selection criteria to the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey and use SED fitting on sources in the region to identify 44 candidate z ≳ 3 quiescent galaxies. Over half of these sources are newly discovered and, on average, exhibit specific star formation rates of poststarburst galaxies. Most of these sources would not be discovered using canonical UVJ diagrams. We derive volume density estimates of n ∼ 1–4 × 10‑5 Mpc‑3 at 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, finding excellent agreement with existing reports on similar populations in the CEERS field. Thanks to NIRCam's wavelength coverage and sensitivity, this technique provides an efficient tool to search for large samples of these rare galaxies.},

The observations resolve the source into at least a dozen kiloparsec-size clumps. The global kinematics and high turbulent velocity dispersion within the galaxies present a striking contrast to recent claims of dynamically cold thin-disk kinematics in some dusty galaxies just 800 Myr later at z {\textasciitilde} 4. We speculate that both gravitational interactions and fragmentation from massive parent disks have likely played a role in the overall dynamics and formation of clumps in the system. Each clump individually is comparable in mass to other 6 {\textless} z {\textless} 8 galaxies identified in rest-UV/optical deep field surveys, but with star formation rates elevated by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3-5.

Given the known spectroscopic redshifts of these sources, we investigated the accuracy with which photometric redshifts can be derived using NIRCam photometry alone, finding that F115W imaging is essential to distinguish between z {\textasciitilde} 8 galaxies with high equivalent width (EW) [O III] λ5007 emission and z {\textasciitilde} 10 Balmer break galaxies. We find that all four sources exhibit strong (≥0.6 mag) F356W-F444W colours, which sit at the extreme end of theoretical predictions from numerical simulations. We find that these galaxies deviate (by ≈0.5 dex) from the local correlation between [O III] λ5007/H β and [Ne III] λ3869/[O II], which is consistent with the predictions from simulations of high-redshift galaxies having elevated line-excitation ratios. We measure the [O III] λ5007 rest-frame EWs both directly from the spectroscopy, and indirectly as inferred from the strong F356W-F444W colours, finding large [O III] λ5007 EWs of 225-1740 Å. The [O III] λ5007 and H β EWs are consistent with those seen in extreme, intensely star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe. Our structural analysis indicates that these galaxies are resolved, exhibiting irregular shapes with bright clumps. In line with the predictions from the FLARES hydrodynamic simulations, such intense star formation and extreme nebular conditions are likely the norm, rather than the exception, in the EoR.},

We use a variety of simulations that account for: errors in source detection and characterisation, clustering, and variations in the assumed source model used to simulate sources within the field and characterise source count incompleteness. We present these deep source count distributions and use them to investigate the contribution of extragalactic sources to the sky background temperature at 1.4 GHz using a relatively large sky area. We then use the wealth of ancillary data covering a subset of the COSMOS field to investigate the specific contributions from both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) to the source counts and sky background temperature. We find, similar to previous deep studies, that we are unable to reconcile the sky temperature observed by the ARCADE 2 experiment. We show that AGN provide the majority contribution to the sky temperature contribution from radio sources, but the relative contribution of SFGs rises sharply below 1 mJy, reaching an approximate 15-25 per cent contribution to the total sky background temperature (Tb {\textasciitilde}100 mK) at {\textasciitilde}15 μJy.},

	abstract = {We present a random forest (RF) framework for predicting circumgalactic medium (CGM) physical conditions from quasar absorption line observables, trained on a sample of Voigt profile-fit synthetic absorbers from the SIMBA cosmological simulation. Traditionally, extracting physical conditions from CGM absorber observations involves simplifying assumptions such as uniform single-phase clouds, but by using a cosmological simulation we bypass such assumptions to better capture the complex relationship between CGM observables and underlying gas conditions. We train RF models on synthetic spectra for H I and selected metal lines around galaxies across a range of star formation rates, stellar masses, and impact parameters, to predict absorber overdensities, temperatures, and metallicities. The models reproduce the true values from SIMBA well, with normalized transverse standard deviations of 0.50-0.54 dex in overdensity, 0.32-0.54 dex in temperature, and 0.49-0.53 dex in metallicity predicted from metal lines (not H I), across all ions. Examining the feature importance, the RF indicates that the overdensity is most informed by the absorber column density, the temperature is driven by the line width, and the metallicity is most sensitive to the specific star formation rate. Alternatively examining feature importance by removing one observable at a time, the overdensity and metallicity appear to be more driven by the impact parameter. We introduce a normalizing flow approach in order to ensure the scatter in the true physical conditions is accurately spanned by the network. The trained models are available online.},

We find the majority of compact galaxies (R1/2, ⋆ {\textless} 1 pkpc, which drive the negative slope of the size-mass relation, have transitioned from extended to compact sizes via efficient centralized cooling, resulting in high specific star formation rates in their cores. These compact stellar systems are enshrouded by non-star-forming gas distributions as much as 100 times larger than their stellar counterparts. By comparing with galaxies from the EAGLE simulation suite, we find that these extended gas distributions 'turn on' and begin to form stars between z = 5 and 0 leading to increasing sizes, and thus the evolution of the size-mass relation from a negative to a positive slope. This explicitly demonstrates the process of inside-out galaxy formation in which compact bulges form earlier than the surrounding discs.},

The equations are derived by combining a tailored graph neural network (GNN) architecture with symbolic regression. We first train the GNN on dark matter halos from Gadget N-body simulations to perform field-level likelihood-free inference, and show that our model can infer Ωm with {\textasciitilde}6\% accuracy from halo catalogs of thousands of N-body simulations run with six different codes: Abacus, CUBEP3M, Gadget, Enzo, PKDGrav3, and Ramses. By applying symbolic regression to the different parts comprising the GNN, we derive equations that can predict Ωm from halo catalogs of simulations run with all of the above codes with accuracies similar to those of the GNN. We show that, by tuning a single free parameter, our equations can also infer the value of Ωm from galaxy catalogs of thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project, each with a different astrophysics model, run with five distinct codes that employ different subgrid physics: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, Astrid, Magneticum, SWIFT-EAGLE. Furthermore, the equations also perform well when tested on galaxy catalogs from simulations covering a vast region in parameter space that samples variations in 5 cosmological and 23 astrophysical parameters. We speculate that the equations may reflect the existence of a fundamental physics relation between the phase-space distribution of generic tracers and Ωm, one that is not affected by galaxy formation physics down to scales as small as 10 h -1 kpc.},

We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z {\textless} 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "little red dot" galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.},

We fit the sample using several publicly available spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and photometric redshift codes and determine their redshifts between z = 9.3 and z = 10.9 ( = 10.0), UV magnitudes between M UV = ‑21.2 and ‑19.5 (with UV{\textgreater} = ‑20.2), and rest-frame UV slopes ({\textless}β{\textgreater} = ‑2.4). These galaxies are, on average, more luminous than most z ≥ 9 candidates discovered by JWST so far in the literature, while exhibiting similar blue colors in their rest-frame UV. The rest-frame UV slopes derived from SED fitting are blue (β ∼ [‑2.0, ‑2.7]) without reaching extremely blue values as reported in other recent studies at these redshifts. The blue color is consistent with models that suggest the underlying stellar population is not yet fully enriched in metals like similarly luminous galaxies in the lower-redshift Universe. The derived stellar masses with {\textless}log10( M ⋆/M ⊙){\textgreater} ≈ 8–9 are not in tension with the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, and our measurement of the volume density of such UV-luminous galaxies aligns well with previously measured values presented in the literature at z ∼ 9–10.

These in turn can be compared with the predictions of galaxy formation simulations allowing us to validate and refine the incorporated physics. However, the inference of physical properties, particularly from photometry alone, can lead to large uncertainties and potential biases. Instead, it is now possible, and common, for simulations to be {\textbackslash}emph\{forward-modelled\} to yield synthetic observations that can be compared directly to real observations. In this work, we measure the JWST broadband fluxes and colours of a robust sample of \$58\$ the distributions differ somewhat, though our observed sample size is small and thus susceptible to statistical fluctuations.

Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {Recent high-resolution interferometric images of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) reveal fascinatingly complex morphologies. This raises a number of questions: how does the relative orientation of a galaxy affect its observed submillimetre emission, and does this result in an 'orientation bias' in the selection and analysis of such galaxies in flux-limited cosmological surveys? We investigated these questions using the SIMBA cosmological simulation paired with the dust radiative transfer code POWDERDAY. We selected eight simulated SMGs (S850 ≳ 2 mJy) at z = 2, and measured the variance of their 'observed' emission over 50 random orientations. Each galaxy exhibits significant scatter in its emission close to the peak of the thermal dust emission, with variation in flux density of up to a factor of 2.7. This results in an appreciable dispersion in the inferred dust temperatures and infrared luminosities (16th-84th percentile ranges of 5 K and 0.1 dex, respectively) and therefore a fundamental uncertainty in derived parameters such as dust mass and star formation rate ({\textasciitilde}30 per cent for the latter using simple calibrations). Using a Monte Carlo simulation we also assessed the impact of orientation on flux-limited surveys, finding a bias in the selection of SMGs towards those with face-on orientations, as well as those at lower redshifts. We predict that the orientation bias will affect flux-limited single-dish surveys, most significantly at THz frequencies, and this bias should be taken into account when placing the results of targeted follow-up studies in a statistical context.},

Furthermore, we test our models on 1024 simulations that cover a vast region in parameter space-variations in five cosmological and 23 astrophysical parameters-finding that the model extrapolates really well.

In this Letter we discuss the implications of the UV radiation background at cosmic dawn inferred by recent JWST observations for radio experiments aimed at detecting the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine transition of diffuse neutral hydrogen. Under the basic assumption that the 21 cm signal is activated by the Lyα photon field produced by metal-poor stellar systems, we show that a detection at the low frequencies of the EDGES and SARAS3 experiments may be expected from a simple extrapolation of the declining UV luminosity density inferred at z ≲ 14 from JWST early galaxy data. Accounting for an early radiation excess above the cosmic microwave background suggests a shallower or flat evolution to simultaneously reproduce low- and high-z current UV luminosity density constraints, which cannot be entirely ruled out, given the large uncertainties from cosmic variance and the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function at cosmic dawn. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a high star formation efficiency at early times may trigger the onset of intense Lyα emission at redshift z ≲ 20 and produce a cosmic 21 cm absorption signal 200 Myr after the Big Bang.},

Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet--near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba \& Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS \${\textbackslash}textit\{ugriz\}\$ and GALEX FUV \& NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling {\textgreater}200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions, and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. Most interestingly we achieve constraints on \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, describing the clustering of matter. This is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation--metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

Both simulations predict that JWST can observe ≥70-90 per cent (for SHARK and FLARES, respectively) of galaxies up to z {\textasciitilde} 10 (down to stellar masses of \$\{{\textbackslash}approx\}10{\textasciicircum}\{8.3\}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and SFRs of \$\{{\textbackslash}approx\}10{\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) in modest integration times and given current proposed survey areas (e.g. the Web COSMOS 0.6 deg2) to accurately constrain the parameters of the SFS. Although both simulations predict qualitatively similar distributions of stellar mass and SFR. There are important quantitative differences, such as the abundance of massive, star-forming galaxies with FLARES predicting a higher abundance than SHARK; the early onset of quenching as a result of black hole growth in FLARES (at z ≍ 8), not seen in SHARK until much lower redshifts; and the implementation of synthetic photometry with FLARES predicting more JWST-detected galaxies ({\textasciitilde}90 per cent) than SHARK ({\textasciitilde}70 per cent) at z = 10. JWST observations will distinguish between these models, leading to a significant improvement upon our understanding of the formation of the very first galaxies.},

The lack of deep rest-frame optical coverage at high redshift has made robust constraints elusive, but this is now changing thanks to JWST. In preparation for the constraints provided by JWST, we explore the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies at z = 5-13 using the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite. Built on the EAGLE model, the unique strategy of FLARES allows us to simulate galaxies with a wide range of stellar masses (and luminosities) and environments. While we predict significant redshift evolution of average ages and specific star formation rates, our core result is mostly a flat relationship of age and specific star formation rate with stellar mass. We also find that galaxies in this epoch predominantly have strongly rising star formation histories, albeit with the normalization dropping with redshift and stellar mass. In terms of chemical enrichment, we predict a strong stellar mass-metallicity relation present at z = 10 and beyond alongside significant α-enhancement. Finally, we find no large-scale environmental dependence of the relationship between age, specific star formation rate, or metallicity with stellar mass.},

	abstract = {With its exquisite sensitivity, wavelength coverage, and spatial and spectral resolution, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is poised to revolutionize our view of the distant, high-redshift (z {\textgreater} 5) Universe. While Webb's spectroscopic observations will be transformative for the field, photometric observations play a key role in identifying distant objects and providing more comprehensive samples than accessible to spectroscopy alone. In addition to identifying objects, photometric observations can also be used to infer physical properties and thus be used to constrain galaxy formation models. However, inferred physical properties from broad-band photometric observations, particularly in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts, often have large uncertainties. With the development of new tools for forward modelling simulations, it is now routinely possible to predict observational quantities, enabling a direct comparison with observations. With this in mind, in this work, we make predictions for the colour evolution of galaxies at z = 5-15 using the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite. We predict a complex evolution with time, driven predominantly by strong nebular line emission passing through individual bands. These predictions are in good agreement with existing constraints from Hubble and Spitzer as well as some of the first results from Webb. We also contrast our predictions with other models in the literature: While the general trends are similar, we find key differences, particularly in the strength of features associated with strong nebular line emission. This suggests photometric observations alone should provide useful discriminating power between different models and physical states of galaxies.},

We explore the resultant luminosity functions, IRX-β relations as well as the luminosity-weighted dust temperatures in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). We find that most of our results are in agreement with the current set of observations, but under-predict the number densities of bright IR galaxies, which are extremely biased towards the most overdense regions. We see that the FLARES IRX-β relation (for 5 ≤ z ≤ 8) predominantly follows the local starburst relation. The IRX shows an increase with stellar mass, plateauing at the high-mass end ({\textasciitilde}1010 M⊙) and shows no evolution in the median normalization with redshift. We also look at the dependence of the peak dust temperature (Tpeak) on various galaxy properties including the stellar mass, IR luminosity and sSFR, finding the correlation to be strongest with sSFR. The luminosity-weighted dust temperatures increase towards higher redshifts, with the slope of the Tpeak - redshift relation showing a higher slope than the lower redshift relations obtained from previous observational and theoretical works. The results from FLARES, which is able to provide a better statistical sample of high-redshift galaxies compared to other simulations, provides a distinct vantage point for the high-redshift Universe.},

The simulations trace the evolution of galaxies in a range of overdensities through the epoch of reionization. With a novel weighting scheme, we combine these overdensities, extending significantly the dynamic range of observed composite distribution functions compared to periodic simulation boxes. FLARES predicts a significantly larger number of intrinsically bright galaxies, which can be explained through a simple model linking dust attenuation to the metal content of the interstellar medium, using a line-of-sight extinction model. With this model, we present the photometric properties of the FLARES galaxies for z ∈ [5, 10]. We show that the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) matches the observations at all redshifts. The function is fitted by Schechter and double power-law forms, with the latter being favoured at these redshifts by the FLARES composite UV LF. We also present predictions for the UV-continuum slope as well as the attenuation in the UV. The impact of environment on the UV LF is also explored, with the brightest galaxies forming in the densest environments. We then present the line luminosity and equivalent widths of some prominent nebular emission lines arising from the galaxies, finding rough agreement with available observations. We also look at the relative contribution of obscured and unobscured star formation, finding comparable contributions at these redshifts.},

constraints on both the galaxy stellar mass function and far-UV (150 nm) luminosity function. Galaxies in BlueTides are characterized by rapidly increasing star formation histories.

As a result of the enhanced surface density of metals, more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust attenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV luminosity function at high luminosities. The contribution of active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to the UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses 109-10 M⊙ is around 3 per cent on average.

This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the protocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of modelling assumptions,
particularly taking into account the shape of the measurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities compared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship between active galactic nucleus (AGN) and protoclusters is also investigated and shows significant evolution with redshift; at z ˜ 2, the fraction of protoclusters traced by AGN is high, but the fraction of all AGNs in protoclusters is low, whereas at z ≥ 5 the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGNs are in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a passive sequence in

Using v2.2.1 of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) model we determine a new set of
calibration coefficients for the ultraviolet, thermal infrared, and hydrogen recombination lines. These ultraviolet and thermal infrared coefficients are 0.15-0.2 dex higher than those widely utilized in the literature while the H α coefficient is ∼0.35 dex larger.
These differences arise in part due to the inclusion binary evolution pathways but predominantly reflect an extension in the IMF to 300 M⊙ and a change in the choice of reference metallicity. We use these new coefficients to recalibrate the cosmic star formation history, and find improved agreement between the integrated cosmic star formation history and the in situ measured stellar mass density as a function of redshift.

this paper, we use 3D dust radiative transfer to model the submm

simulations, and compare predictions to the latest single-dish
observational constraints on the abundance of 850 μm-selected
sources. We find good agreement with the shape of the integrated 850
μm luminosity function, and the normalization is within 0.25 dex at
{\textgreater}3 mJy, unprecedented for a fully cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation, along with good agreement in the redshift distribution of
bright SMGs. The agreement is driven primarily by SIMBA's good match to
infrared measures of the star formation rate (SFR) function between z =
2 and 4 at high SFRs. Also important is the self-consistent on-the-fly
dust model in SIMBA, which predicts, on average, higher dust masses (by
up to a factor of 2.5) compared to using a fixed dust-to-metals ratio of
0.3. We construct a light-cone to investigate the effect of far-field
blending, and find that 52 per cent of sources are blends of multiple
components, which makes a small contribution to the normalization of the
bright end of the number counts. We provide new fits to the 850 μm
luminosity as a function of SFR and dust mass. Our results demonstrate
that solutions to the discrepancy between submm counts in simulations

We include our stellar population synthesis modeling on the fly, allowing significant flexibility in the assumed stellar physics and nebular line emission. The dust content follows either simple observationally motivated prescriptions (i.e., constant dust-to-metals ratios, or dust-to-gas ratios that vary with metallicity), direct modeling from galaxy formation simulations that include dust physics, as well as a novel approach that includes the dust content via learning-based algorithms from the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can additionally be included via a range of prescriptions. The output of these models are broadband (912 Å–1 mm) spectral energy distributions (SEDs), as well as filter-convolved monochromatic images. powderday is designed to eliminate last-mile efforts by researchers that employ different hydrodynamic galaxy formation models and seamlessly interfaces with gizmo, arepo, gasoline, changa, and enzo. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code via three applications: a model for the star formation rate–infrared luminosity relation in galaxies (including the impact of AGNs), the impact of circumstellar dust around AGB stars on the mid-infrared emission from galaxy SEDs, and the impact of galaxy inclination angle on dust attenuation laws.},

On dust-attenuated spectra we achieve high test accuracy (median SMAPE = 10.5 per cent). Including the effects of simulated observational noise increases the error (12.5 per cent), however this is alleviated by including multiple realizations of the noise, which increases the training set size and reduces overfitting (10.9 per cent). We also make estimates for the observational and modelling errors. To further evaluate the generalization properties we apply models trained on one simulation to spectra from the other, which leads to only a small increase in the error (median SMAPE ̃ 15 per cent). We apply each trained model to SDSS DR7 spectra, and find smoother histories than in the vespa catalogue. This new approach complements the results of existing spectral energy distribution fitting techniques, providing SFHs directly motivated by the results of the latest cosmological simulations.},

resimulate a range of overdensities during the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) in order to build composite distribution functions, as well as
explore the environmental dependence of galaxy formation and evolution
during this critical period of galaxy assembly. The regions are selected
from a large \$(3.2 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cGpc\}){\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ parent volume, based on
their overdensity within a sphere of radius 14 h-1 cMpc. We
then resimulate with full hydrodynamics, and employ a novel weighting
scheme that allows the construction of composite distribution functions
that are representative of the full parent volume. This significantly
extends the dynamic range compared to smaller volume periodic
simulations. We present an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function
(GSMF), the star formation rate distribution function (SFRF), and the
star-forming sequence (SFS) predicted by FLARES, and compare to a number
of observational and model constraints. We also analyse the
environmental dependence over an unprecedented range of overdensity.
Both the GSMF and the SFRF exhibit a clear double-Schechter form, up to
the highest redshifts (z = 10). We also find no environmental dependence
of the SFS normalization. The increased dynamic range probed by FLARES
will allow us to make predictions for a number of large area surveys
that will probe the EoR in coming years, carried out on new
observatories such as Roman and Euclid.},

While nebular-line emission has been extensively studied at lower redshift there are currently only few constraints within the epoch of reionization (EoR; z {\textgreater} 6), chiefly due to the lack of sensitive near-IR spectrographs. However, this will soon change with the arrival of the Webb Telescope providing sensitive near-IR spectroscopy covering the rest-frame UV and optical emission of galaxies in the EoR. In anticipation of Webb, we combine the large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation BlueTides with photoionization modelling to predict the nebular emission-line properties of galaxies at z = 8 → 13. We find good agreement with the, albeit limited, existing direct and indirect observational constraints on equivalent widths though poorer agreement with luminosity function constraints.},

	abstract = {The emergence of passive galaxies in the early Universe results from the delicate interplay among the different physical processes responsible for their rapid assembly and the abrupt shut-down of their star formation activity. Investigating the individual properties and demographics of early passive galaxies improves our understanding of these mechanisms. In this work we present a follow-up analysis of the z \&gt; 3 passive galaxy candidates selected by Merlin et al. (2019, MNRAS, 490, 3309) in the CANDELS fields. We begin by first confirming the accuracy of their passive classification by exploiting their sub-millimetre emission to demonstrate the lack of ongoing star formation. Using archival ALMA observations we are able to confirm at least 61\% of the observed candidates as passive. While the remainder lack sufficiently deep data for confirmation, we are able to validate the entire sample in a statistical sense. We then estimate the stellar mass function (SMF) of all 101 passive candidates in three redshift bins from z = 5 to z = 3. We adopt a stepwise approach that has the advantage of taking into account photometric errors, mass and selection completeness issues, as well as the Eddington bias, without any a posteriori correction. We observe a pronounced evolution in the SMF around z ∼ 4, indicating that we are witnessing the emergence of the passive population at this epoch. Massive (M \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) passive galaxies, only accounting for a small (\&lt; 10\%) fraction of galaxies at z \&gt; 4, become dominant at later epochs. Thanks to a combination of photometric quality, sample selection, and methodology, we overall find a higher density of passive galaxies than in previous works. The comparison with theoretical predictions, despite a qualitative agreement (at least for some of the models considered), denotes a still incomplete understanding of the physical processes responsible for the formation of these galaxies. Finally, we extrapolate our results to predict the number of early passive galaxies expected in surveys carried out with future facilities.},

	abstract = {High-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations are currently limited to relatively small volumes due to their computational expense. However, much larger volumes are required to probe rare, overdense environments, and measure clustering statistics of the large-scale structure. Typically, zoom simulations of individual regions are used to study rare environments, and semi-analytic models and halo occupation models applied to dark-matter-only (DMO) simulations are used to study the Universe in the large-volume regime. We propose a new approach, using a machine learning framework, to explore the halo-galaxy relationship in the periodic EAGLE simulations, and zoom C-EAGLE simulations of galaxy clusters. We train a tree-based machine learning method to predict the baryonic properties of galaxies based on their host dark matter halo properties. The trained model successfully reproduces a number of key distribution functions for an infinitesimal fraction of the computational cost of a full hydrodynamic simulation. By training on both periodic simulations and zooms of overdense environments, we learn the bias of galaxy evolution in differing environments. This allows us to apply the trained model to a larger DMO volume than would be possible if we only trained on a periodic simulation. We demonstrate this application using the (800 Mpc)3 P-Millennium simulation, and present predictions for key baryonic distribution functions and clustering statistics from the EAGLE model in this large volume.},

We employ a statistical approach measuring the average observed 850 μm flux density of near-infrared selected galaxies as a function of redshift. The redshift range considered corresponds to a span where the 850 μm band probes the Rayleigh–Jeans tail of thermal dust emission in the rest frame, and can therefore be used as an estimate of the mass of the interstellar medium. Our sample comprises of ≈150,000 galaxies in the UK InfraRed Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey Ultra-Deep Survey field with near-infrared magnitudes K AB ≤ 25 mag and photometric redshifts with corresponding probability distribution functions derived from deep 12-band photometry. With a sample approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in previous works we significantly reduce statistical uncertainties on to z ≈ 2.5. Our measurements are in broad agreement with recent direct estimates from blank field molecular gas surveys, finding that the epoch of molecular gas coincides with the peak epoch of star formation with at z ≈ 2. We demonstrate that can be broadly modeled by inverting the star formation rate (SFR) density with a fixed or weakly evolving star formation efficiency. This “constant efficiency” model shows a similar evolution to our statistically derived , indicating that the dominant factor driving the peak star formation history at z ≈ 2 is a larger supply of molecular gas in galaxies rather than a significant evolution of the SFR efficiency within individual galaxies.},

	abstract = {The Baldwin, Philips, \& Terlevich diagram of [O III]/Hβ versus [N II]/Hα (hereafter N2-BPT) has long been used as a tool for classifying galaxies based on the dominant source of ionizing radiation. Recent observations have demonstrated that galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2 reside offset from local galaxies in the N2-BPT space. In this paper, we conduct a series of controlled numerical experiments to understand the potential physical processes driving this offset. We model nebular line emission in a large sample of galaxies, taken from the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation, using the CLOUDY photoionization code to compute the nebular line luminosities from H II regions. We find that the observed shift toward higher [O III]/Hβ and [N II]/Hα values at high redshift arises from sample selection: when we consider only the most massive galaxies M * {\textasciitilde} 1010-11 M ⊙, the offset naturally appears, due to their high metallicities. We predict that deeper observations that probe lower-mass galaxies will reveal galaxies that lie on a locus comparable to z {\textasciitilde} 0 observations. Even when accounting for samples-selection effects, we find that there is a subtle mismatch between simulations and observations. To resolve this discrepancy, we investigate the impact of varying ionization parameters, H II region densities, gas-phase abundance patterns, and increasing radiation field hardness on N2-BPT diagrams. We find that either decreasing the ionization parameter or increasing the N/O ratio of galaxies at fixed O/H can move galaxies along a self-similar arc in N2-BPT space that is occupied by high-redshift galaxies.},

To date, robust passive galaxy candidates have been detected up to z ≤ 5, but it is still unknown if they exist at higher redshifts, what their relative abundances are, and what causes them to stop forming stars. We present predictions from the first light and reionisation epoch simulations (FLARES), a series of zoom simulations of a range of overdensities using the EAGLE code. Passive galaxies occur naturally in the EAGLE model at high redshift, and are in good agreement with number density estimates from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and early JWST results at 3 ≤ z ≤ 5. Due to the unique FLARES approach, we extend these predictions to higher redshifts, finding passive galaxy populations up to z {\textasciitilde} 8. Feedback from supermassive black holes is the main driver of passivity, leading to reduced gas fractions and star forming gas reservoirs. We find that passive galaxies at z ≥ 5 are not identified in the typical UVJ selection space due to their still relatively young stellar populations, and present new rest-frame selection regions. We also produce mock NIRCam and MIRI fluxes, and find that significant numbers of passive galaxies at z ≥ 5 should be detectable in upcoming wide surveys with JWST. Finally, we present JWST colour distributions, with new selection regions in the observer-frame for identifying these early passive populations.},

All sources were classified by six individual classifiers using a simple classification scheme aimed at producing disk/spheroid/peculiar classifications, whereby we determine how the relative number of these morphologies has evolved since the Universe’s first billion years. Additionally, we explore structural and quantitative morphology measurements using Morfometryka, and show that galaxies with M * {\textgreater} 109 M ⊙ at z {\textgreater} 3 are not dominated by irregular and peculiar structures, either visually or quantitatively, as previously thought. We find a strong dominance of morphologically selected disk galaxies up to z = 6 in this mass range. We also find that the stellar mass and star formation rate densities are dominated by disk galaxies up to z ∼ 6, demonstrating that most stars in the Universe were likely formed in a disk galaxy. We compare our results to theory to show that the fraction of types we find is predicted by cosmological simulations, and that the Hubble Sequence was already in place as early as one billion years after the Big Bang.

This is the first time such predictions have been made using a hydrodynamical model validated at low redshift. Our predictions at z = 10 are broadly in agreement with current observational constraints on the far-UV luminosity function and UV continuum slope β, though the observational uncertainties are large. We note tension with recent constraints z {\textasciitilde} 13 from Harikane et al. (2021) - compared to these constraints, FLARES predicts objects with the same space density should have an order-of-magnitude lower luminosity, though this is mitigated slightly if dust attenuation is negligible in these systems.

However, the Balmer break is also sensitive to the shape of the star formation history, the stellar (and gas) metallicity, the presence of nebular continuum emission, and dust attenuation. In this work, we explore the origin of the Balmer/4000 Å break using the SYNTHESIZER synthetic observations package. We then make predictions of the Balmer/4000 Å break using the First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations at 5 {\textless} z {\textless} 10. We find that the average break strength weakly correlates with stellar mass and rest-frame far-ultraviolet luminosity, but that this is predominantly driven by dust attenuation.

Our predictions are largely consistent with recent observational constraints on the luminosity function, average EWs, and line ratios. However, they fail to reproduce the observed tail of high-EW sources and the number density of extreme line emitters. Possibilities to explain these discrepancies include an additional source of ionizing photons and/or greater stochasticity in star formation in the model or photometric scatter and/or bias in the observations.

We use the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to measure the galaxy bias of various tracers over an unprecedentedly large range in overdensity for a hydrodynamic simulation, and use these relations to assess the impact of bias and clustering on survey variance in the EoR. Star formation is highly biased relative to the underlying dark matter distribution, with the mean ratio of the stellar to dark matter density varying by a factor of 100 between regions of low and high matter overdensity (smoothed on a scale of 14 h-1 cMpc). This is reflected in the galaxy distribution - the most massive galaxies are found solely in regions of high overdensity. As a consequence of the above, galaxies in the EoR are highly clustered, which can lead to a large variance in survey number counts. For mean number counts N ≲ 100 (1000), in a unit redshift slice of angular area 300 arcmin2 (1.4 deg2), the 2σ range in N is roughly a factor of four (two). We present relations between the expected variance and survey area for different survey geometries; these relations will be of use to observers wishing to understand the impact of survey variance on their results.},

	abstract = {Using the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the consequences of a realistic model for star-dust geometry on the observed properties of galaxies. We find that the ultraviolet (UV) attenuation declines rapidly from the central regions of galaxies, and bright galaxies have spatially extended star formation that suffers less obscuration than their fainter counterparts, demonstrating a non-linear relationship between the UV luminosity and the UV attenuation, giving a double power-law shape to the UVLF. Spatially distinct stellar populations within galaxies experience a wide range of dust attenuation due to variations in the dust optical depth along their line of sight, which can range from completely dust obscured to being fully unobscured. The overall attenuation curve of a galaxy is then a complex combination of various lines of sight within the galaxy. We explore the manifestation of this effect to study the reliability of line ratios to infer galaxy properties, in particular, the Balmer decrement and the Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We find the Balmer decrement predicted Balmer-line attenuation to be higher (factor of 1 to ≳ 10) than expected from commonly used attenuation curves. The observed BPT line ratios deviate from their intrinsic values [median difference of 0.08 (0.02) and standard deviation of 0.2 (0.05) for log10([N\$\{{\textbackslash}small II\}]{\textbackslash}lambda 6585/\$Hα) (log10([O III]λ5008/Hβ)]. Finally, we explore the variation in observed properties (UV attenuation, UV slope, and Balmer decrement) with viewing angle, finding average differences of {\textasciitilde}0.3 mag in the UV attenuation.},

	abstract = {The history of reionization is highly dependent on the ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies. It is therefore important to have a solid understanding of how the ionizing properties of galaxies are linked to physical and observable quantities. In this paper, we use the First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to study the Lyman-continuum (LyC, i.e. hydrogen-ionizing) emission of massive (\$M\_* 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) galaxies at redshifts z = 5 - 10. We find that the specific ionizing emissivity (i.e. intrinsic ionizing emissivity per unit stellar mass) decreases as stellar mass increases, due to the combined effects of increasing age and metallicity. FLARES predicts a median ionizing photon production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic ionizing emissivity per unit intrinsic far-UV luminosity) of \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}({\textbackslash}xi \_\{{\textbackslash}rm ion\}{\textbackslash}rm \{/erg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}Hz\})=25.40{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.17\}\$, with values spanning the range \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}({\textbackslash}xi \_\{{\textbackslash}rm ion\}{\textbackslash}rm \{/erg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}Hz\})=25-25.75\$. This is within the range of many observational estimates, but below some of the extremes observed. We compare the production efficiency with observable properties, and find a weak negative correlation with the UV-continuum slope, and a positive correlation with the [O III] equivalent width. We also consider the dust-attenuated production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic ionizing emissivity per unit dust-attenuated far-UV luminosity), and find a median of \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}({\textbackslash}xi \_\{{\textbackslash}rm ion\}{\textbackslash}rm \{/erg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}Hz\}){\textbackslash}sim 25.5\$. Within our sample of \$M\_* 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ galaxies, it is the stellar populations in low mass galaxies that contribute the most to the total ionizing emissivity. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emission accounts for 10 - 20 per cent of the total emissivity at a given redshift, and extends the LyC luminosity function by {\textasciitilde}0.5 dex.},

We investigate the dependency of age and metallicity radial gradients on galaxy morphology, stellar mass, stellar surface mass density (Σ*), and environment. The key of our analysis is that observational biases affecting the interpretation of MaNGA data are emulated in the theoretical iMaNGA sample. The simulations reproduce the observed global stellar population scaling relations with positive correlations between galaxy mass and age/metallicity quite well and also produce younger stellar populations in late-type in agreement with observations. We do find interesting discrepancies, though, that can inform the physics and further development of the simulations. Ages of spiral galaxies and low-mass ellipticals are overestimated by about 2-4 Gyr. Radial metallicity gradients are steeper in iMaNGA than in MaNGA, a discrepancy most prominent in spiral and lenticular galaxies. Also, the observed steepening of metallicity gradients with increasing galaxy mass is not well matched by the simulations. We find that the theoretical radial profiles of surface mass density Σ* are steeper than in observations except for the most massive galaxies. In both MaNGA and iMaNGA [Z/H] correlates with Σ*, however, the simulations systematically predict lower [Z/H] by almost a factor of 2 at any Σ*. Most interestingly, for galaxies with stellar mass log M* ≤ 10.80 M⊙, the MaNGA data reveal a positive correlation between galaxy radius and [Z/H] at fixed Σ*, which is not recovered in iMaNGA. Finally, the dependence on environmental density is negligible in both the theoretical iMaNGA and the observed MaNGA data.},

	abstract = {We quantify the cosmological spread of baryons relative to their initial neighbouring dark matter distribution using thousands of state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project. We show that dark matter particles spread relative to their initial neighbouring distribution owing to chaotic gravitational dynamics on spatial scales comparable to their host dark matter halo. In contrast, gas in hydrodynamic simulations spreads much further from the initial neighbouring dark matter owing to feedback from supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We show that large-scale baryon spread is very sensitive to model implementation details, with the fiducial SIMBA model spreading {\textasciitilde}40 per cent of baryons {\textgreater}1 Mpc away compared to {\textasciitilde}10 per cent for the IllustrisTNG and ASTRID models. Increasing the efficiency of AGN-driven outflows greatly increases baryon spread while increasing the strength of SNe-driven winds can decrease spreading due to non-linear coupling of stellar and AGN feedback. We compare total matter power spectra between hydrodynamic and paired N-body simulations and demonstrate that the baryonic spread metric broadly captures the global impact of feedback on matter clustering over variations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, initial conditions, and (to a lesser extent) galaxy formation models. Using symbolic regression, we find a function that reproduces the suppression of power by feedback as a function of wave number (k) and baryonic spread up to \$k {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, h\$ Mpc-1 in SIMBA while highlighting the challenge of developing models robust to variations in galaxy formation physics implementation.},

While this early star formation can contribute substantially to the total stellar mass of high-redshift systems, ongoing star formation at the time of detection outshines the residual light from earlier bursts, hampering the determination of accurate stellar masses. As a result, order-of-magnitude uncertainties in stellar masses can be expected. We demonstrate this potential problem via direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. In detail, we carry out two cosmological simulations with significantly different stellar feedback models, which span a significant range in SFH burstiness. We compute the mock SEDs for these model galaxies at z = 7 via calculations of 3D dust radiative transfer, and then backward fit these SEDs with PROSPECTOR SED fitting software. The uncertainties in derived stellar masses that we find for z {\textgreater} 7 galaxies motivate the development of new techniques and/or priors for SFH to model star formation in the early Universe.},

In this work, we investigate the relationship between the star formation activity of galaxies and their environmental matter density using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA. The galactic star formation activity indicators that we explore include the star formation efficiency (SFE), specific star formation rate (sSFR), and molecular hydrogen mass fraction (\$f{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2\}\}\$), and the environment is considered as the large-scale environmental matter density, calculated based on the stellar mass of nearby galaxies on a 1 h-1 Mpc grid using the cloud in cell method. Our sample includes galaxies with \$9 {\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}frac\{M\_*\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$ at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 4, divided into three stellar mass bins to disentangle the effects of stellar mass and environment on the star formation activity of galaxies. For low- to intermediate-mass galaxies at low redshifts (z {\textless} 1.5), we find that the star formation efficiency of those in high-density regions are {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex lower than those in low-density regions. However, there is no significant environmental dependence of the star formation efficiency for massive galaxies over all our redshift range, and low- to intermediate-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z {\textgreater} 1.5). We present a scaling relation for the depletion time of cold molecular hydrogen (tdepl = 1/SFE) as a function of galaxy parameters including environmental density. Our findings provide a framework for quantifying the environmental effects on the star formation activities of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift. The most significant environmental dependence is seen at later cosmic times (z {\textless} 1.5) and towards lower stellar masses (\$9 {\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}frac\{M\_*\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\} 10\$).

Upgrades to submillimetre (submm) interferometers and the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope will soon offer the opportunity to find more distant candidate proto-clusters in deep sky surveys without any spectroscopic confirmation. In this Letter, we report the serendipitous discovery of an extremely dense region centred on the blazar, J0217−0820, at z = 0.6 in the ALMACAL sky survey. Its density is eight times higher than that predicted by blind submm surveys. Among the seven submm-bright galaxies, three are as bright as conventional single-dish submm galaxies, with S870 μm {\textgreater} 3 mJy. The over-density is thus comparable to the densest known and confirmed proto-cluster cores. However, their spectra betray a wide range of redshifts. We investigate the likelihood of line-of-sight projection effects using light cones from cosmological simulations, finding that the deeper we search, the higher the chance that we will suffer from such projection effects. The extreme over-density around J0217−0820 demonstrates the strong cosmic variance we may encounter in the deep submm surveys. Thus, we should also question the fidelity of galaxy proto-cluster candidates selected via over-densities of galaxies, where the negative K correction eases the detection of dusty galaxies along an extraordinarily extended line of sight.},

We employ the large effective volume of FLARES to produce a sizeable sample of high-redshift galaxies with intrinsic and observed luminosities and half-light radii in a range of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and visual photometric bands. This sample contains a significant number of intrinsically ultracompact galaxies in the far-UV (1500 Å), leading to a negative intrinsic far-UV size-luminosity relation. However, after the inclusion of the effects of dust these same compact galaxies exhibit observed sizes that are as much as 50 times larger than those measured from the intrinsic emission, and broadly agree with a range of observational samples. This increase in size is driven by the concentration of dust in the core of galaxies, heavily attenuating the intrinsically brightest regions. At fixed luminosity we find a galaxy size redshift evolution with a slope of m = 1.21-1.87 depending on the luminosity sample in question, and we demonstrate the wavelength dependence of the size-luminosity relation that will soon be probed by the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {The discovery of extremely luminous galaxies at ultra-high redshifts (z ≳ 8) has challenged galaxy formation models. Most analyses of this tension have not accounted for the variance due to field-to-field clustering, which causes the number counts of galaxies to vary greatly in excess of Poisson noise. This super-Poissonian variance is often referred to as cosmic variance. Since cosmic variance increases rapidly as a function of mass, redshift, and smaller observing areas, the most massive objects in deep JWST surveys are severely impacted by cosmic variance. We construct a simple model, including cosmic variance, to predict the distribution of the mass of the most massive galaxy for different surveys, which increases the tension with observations. The distributions differ significantly from previous predictions using the Extreme Value Statistics formalism, changing the position and shape of the distributions. We test our model using the UniverseMachine simulations, where the predicted effects of cosmic variance are clearly identifiable. We find that the high skew in the distributions of galaxy counts for typical deep surveys imply a high statistical variance on the cosmic variance itself. This impacts the calibration of the cosmic variance, as well as the expected mass of the most massive galaxy. We also find that the impact of cosmic variance dominates the impact of any realistic scatter in the stellar-to-halo-mass relation at z ≳ 12. It is therefore crucial to accurately account for the impact of cosmic variance in any analysis of tension between early extreme galaxies and galaxy formation models.},

Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation curves and fit them with a parametric model that captures known extinction and attenuation laws (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions of the best-fitting parameters: UV slope (\$c\_1\$), optical-to-NIR slope (\$c\_2\$), FUV slope (\$c\_3\$), 2175 Angstrom bump strength (\$c\_4\$), and normalization (\$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}\$). Key correlations emerge between \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}\$ and the star formation rate surface density \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$, as well as the UV slope \$c\_1\$. The UV and FUV slopes (\$c\_1, c\_3\$) and the bump strength and visual attenuation (\$c\_4, A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}\$) exhibit robust internal correlations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling relations that predict a galaxy's median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation curve based solely on its \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$ and/or \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}\$. These predictions agree well with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog despite minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, providing a foundation for physically motivated priors in SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration.},

Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts (\$3 {\textless} z {\textless} 5\$) currently present one of the most pressing problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe.

High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations are limited to small volumes by their large computational demands, hindering their use for comparisons with wide-field observational surveys. We overcome this limitation by using the First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of high-resolution (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{gas\}\} = 1.8{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm \{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) zoom simulations drawn from a large, \$(3.2{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm \{cGpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ box. We use an extremely randomized trees machine learning approach to model the relationship between galaxies and their subhaloes in a wide range of environments. This allows us to build mock catalogues with dynamic ranges that surpass those obtainable through periodic simulations. The low cost of the zoom simulations facilitates multiple runs of the same regions, differing only in the random number seed of the subgrid models; changing this seed introduces a butterfly effect, leading to random differences in the properties of matching galaxies. This randomness cannot be learnt by a deterministic machine learning model, but by sampling the noise and adding it post-facto to our predictions, we are able to recover the distributions of the galaxy properties we predict (stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity and size) remarkably well. We also explore the resolution dependence of our models' performances and find minimal depreciation down to particle resolutions of the order of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{DM\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm \{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, enabling the future application of our models to large dark matter-only boxes.},

	abstract = {It has been recently shown that a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift surveys is to train graph neural networks to perform field-level likelihood-free inference without imposing cuts on scale. In particular, de Santi et al. [58] developed models that could accurately infer the value of Ωm from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to different astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including (1) masking, (2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and (3) different galaxy population selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, which entangles the galaxy radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that while such effects degrade the precision and accuracy of the models, the fraction of galaxy catalogs for which the models retain high performance and robustness is over 90\%, demonstrating the potential for applying them to real data.},

	abstract = {During the most active period of star formation in galaxies, which occurs in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3, strong bursts of star formation result in significant quantities of dust, which obscures new stars being formed as their UV/optical light is absorbed and then re-emitted in the infrared, which redshifts into the mm/sub-mm bands for these early times. To get a complete picture of the high-z galaxy population, we need to survey a large patch of the sky in the sub-mm with sufficient angular resolution to resolve all galaxies, but we also need the depth to fully sample their cosmic evolution, and therefore obtain their redshifts using direct mm spectroscopy with a very wide frequency coverage. This requires a large single-dish sub-mm telescope with fast mapping speeds at high sensitivity and angular resolution, a large bandwidth with good spectral resolution and multiplex spectroscopic capabilities. The proposed 50-m Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) will deliver these specifications. We discuss how AtLAST allows us to study the whole population of high-z galaxies, including the dusty star-forming ones which can only be detected and studied in the sub-mm, and obtain a wealth of information for each of these up to z ∼ 7: gas content, cooling budget, star formation rate, dust mass, and dust temperature. We present worked examples of surveys that AtLAST can perform, both deep and wide, and also focused on galaxies in proto-clusters. In addition we show how such surveys with AtLAST can measure the growth rate fσ 8 and the Hubble constant with high accuracy, and demonstrate the power of the line-intensity mapping method in the mm/sub-mm wavebands to constrain the cosmic expansion history at high redshifts, as good examples of what can uniquely be done by AtLAST in this research field.},

These data were obtained with JWST NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey, which we introduce in this work. The first two galaxies are newly selected from PRIMER UDS imaging, both at \$z=4.62\$ and separated by 860 pkpc on the sky, within a larger structure for which we confirm several other members. Both formed at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 8-10\$. These systems could plausibly merge by the present day to produce a local massive elliptical galaxy. The other two ultra-massive quiescent galaxies are previously known at \$z=3.99\$ and 3.19, with the latter (ZF-UDS-7329) having been the subject of debate as potentially too old and too massive to be accommodated by the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-CDM halo-mass function. Both exhibit high stellar metallicities, and for ZF-UDS-7329 we are able to measure the \${\textbackslash}alpha -\$enhancement, obtaining [Mg/Fe] = \$0.42{\textasciicircum}\{+0.19\}\_\{-0.17\}\$. We finally evaluate whether these four galaxies are consistent with the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-CDM halo-mass function using an extreme value statistics approach. We find that the \$z=4.62\$ objects and the \$z=3.19\$ object are unlikely within our area under the assumption of standard stellar fractions (\$f\_*{\textbackslash}simeq 0.1-0.2\$). However, these objects roughly align with the most massive galaxies expected under the assumption of 100 per cent conversion of baryons to stars (\$f\_*\$=1). Our results suggest extreme galaxy formation physics during the first billion years, but no conflict with \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-CDM cosmology.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of copious amounts of dust in quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshifts (z ≳ 1 ‑ 2) challenge the conventional view that these objects have a negligible interstellar medium (ISM) in proportion to their stellar mass. We made use of the SIMBA hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to explore how dust and cold gas evolve in QGs and are linked to the quenching processes affecting them. We applied a novel method for tracking the changes in the ISM dust abundance across the evolutionary history of QGs identified at 0 {\textless} z ≲ 2 in both cluster and field environments. The QGs transition from a diversity of quenching pathways, both rapidly and slowly, and they exhibit a wide range of times that elapsed between the quenching event and cold gas removal (from ∼650 Myr to ∼8 Gyr). Contrary to some claims, we find that quenching modes attributed to the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) do not affect dust and cold gas within the same timescales. Remarkably, QGs may replenish their dust content in the quenched phase primarily due to internal processes and marginally by external factors such as minor mergers. Prolonged grain growth on gas-phase metals appears to be the key mechanism for dust re-formation, which is effective within ∼100 Myr after the quenching event and rapidly increases the dust-to-gas mass ratio in QGs above the standard values (δDGR ≳ 1/100). Consequently, despite heavily depleted cold gas reservoirs, roughly half of QGs maintain little evolution of their ISM dust with stellar age within the first 2 Gyr following the quenching. Overall, we predict that relatively dusty QGs (Mdust/M⋆ ≳ 10‑3 ‑ 10‑4) arise from both fast and slow quenchers, and they are prevalent in quenched systems of intermediate and low stellar masses (9 {\textless} log(M⋆/M⊙) {\textless} 10.5). This strong prediction poses an immediate quest for observational synergy between, for example, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA).},

The galaxies were post-processed using the SKIRT radiative transfer code to self-consistently obtain the full spectral energy distribution (SED) and surface brightness distribution. We created mock observations of the galaxies for the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to study the rest-frame UV (1500 Å) morphology. We also generated mock rest-frame FIR (50 μm) photometry and mock ALMA 158 μm (0.01'' ‑ 0.03'' and ≈0.3'' angular resolution) observations to study the dust-continuum sizes. We find the effect of dust on observed sizes is reduced with a rising wavelength from the UV to optical (∼0.6 times the UV at 0.4 μm), with no evolution in FIR sizes. Observed sizes vary within 0.4 ‑ 1.2 times the intrinsic sizes at different signal-to-noise ratios (S/N =5 ‑ 20) across redshifts. The effects of the point spread function (PSF) and noise makes bright structures prominent, whereas fainter regions blend with noise, leading to an underestimation (by a factor of 0.4 ‑ 0.8) of sizes at S/N =5. At S/N =15 ‑ 20, the underestimation reduces (factor of 0.6 ‑ 0.9) at z = 5 ‑ 8, but due to the PSF, at z = 9 ‑ 10, bright cores are dominant, resulting in an overestimation (factor of 1.0–1.2) of sizes. For ALMA, low (≈0.3'') resolution sizes are affected by noise that tends to behave as extended emission. The size evolution in UV is in overall agreement with current observational samples and other simulations. This work is one of the first to analyse the panchromatic sizes of a statistically significant sample of simulated high-redshift galaxies. These results supplement a growing body of research highlighting the importance of conducting equivalent comparisons between observed galaxies and their simulated counterparts in the early Universe.},

	abstract = {Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to at z=5. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ( 5≤z≤10). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range z=5→10. Comparison between our predicted mass and bolometric luminosity functions and pre-JWST observations yielded a reasonable match. However, recent JWST observations appear to suggest a higher density of SMBHs at z≈5 and the presence of more luminous SMBHs at z{\textgreater}6 than predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at z{\textgreater}5, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.},

	abstract = {We develop a photometric search method for identifying smouldering galaxies at \$5 z 8\$, which are defined to have weak emission lines and thus generally have low specific star formation rates and may even be in a state of (temporary) quiescence. The deep NIRCam imaging (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}29.5\$ AB mag, 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) from the JADES second data release is essential for finding these systems, as they are faint, relatively quiescent dwarf galaxies (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!9\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot)\$ in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Moreover, medium band imaging is key, enabling a clear identification of the lack of emission lines in these galaxies, thus betraying their dormant flame. Owing to the young age of the Universe, combined with the likely bursty star formation in these first dwarf galaxies, conventional colour-selection methods like the UVJ diagram likely miss a large fraction of the quiescent population in the EoR. Indeed, we find that smouldering galaxies constitute a considerable fraction (0.05-0.35) of the EoR dwarf galaxy population (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!9\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). As predicted by simulations, these first dwarf galaxies are fragile, the star formation in their shallow potential wells easily snuffed out by feedback-driven winds triggered by secular or merger-driven starbursts, with the smouldering fraction increasing with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, we provide observational constraints on the smouldering galaxy comoving number density (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ dex\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), which, although hampered by incompleteness, should aid in our understanding of the primordial baryon cycle, as current simulations greatly disagree on whether these systems are rare (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}1{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$) or common (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}50{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$) in the EoR.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at \$z{\textgreater}3\$ used to largely rely on rest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and massive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming galaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at \$z{\textbackslash}sim\$3-6 with extreme red colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), covering \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 60 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$, and ancillary Spitzer observations, we identified 27000 extremely red objects with \$H\_E-\{{\textbackslash}rm IRAC\}2{\textgreater}2.25\$ (dubbed HIEROs) down to a \$10{\textbackslash}sigma\$ completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 \$=\$ 22.5 AB. After a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling photometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved the physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool CIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at \$z{\textgreater}3\$, with some reaching extreme stellar masses (\$M\_*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and exhibiting high dust attenuation (\$A\_V{\textgreater}3\$). However, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for \$z{\textgreater}3.5\$, favouring a lower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising these objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating shorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve degeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest galaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these sources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates Euclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive, dust-obscured galaxies at \$z{\textgreater}3\$, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA, and ELT.},

	abstract = {Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textless}4000\$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z{\textless}4. We utilise the 63 \$deg{\textasciicircum}2\$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z{\textless}7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z{\textless}4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.},

	abstract = {The extent to which the environment affects galaxy evolution has been under scrutiny by researchers for decades. With the first data from Euclid, we can begin to study a wide range of environments and their effects as a function of redshift, using 63 sq deg of space-based data. In this paper, we present results from the Euclid Q1 Release, where we measure the passive-density and morphology-density relations at \$z=0.25\$-1. We determine if a galaxy is passive using the specific star-formation rate, and we classify the morphologies of galaxies using the Sérsic index n and the u-r colours. We measure the local environmental density of each galaxy using the Nth-nearest neighbour method. We find that at fixed stellar mass, the quenched fraction increases with increasing density up to \$z=0.75\$. This result shows the separability of the effects from the stellar mass and the environment, at least at \$z{\textless}0.75\$. At \$z{\textgreater}0.75\$, we observe weak environmental effects, with most high mass galaxies being quenched independently of environment. Up to \$z=0.75\$, the ETG fraction increases with density at fixed stellar mass, meaning the environment also transforms the morphology of the galaxy independently of stellar mass, at low mass. For high mass galaxies, almost all galaxies are early-types, with low impact from the environment. At \$z{\textgreater}0.75\$, the morphology depends mostly on stellar mass, with only low-mass galaxies being affected by the environment. Given that the morphology classifications use u-r colours, these are correlated to the star-formation rate, and as such our morphology results should be taken with caution; future morphology classifications should verify these results. To summarise, we identify the passive-density and morphology-density relations at \$z{\textless}0.75\$, but at \$z{\textgreater}0.75\$ the relations are less strong. At \$z{\textgreater}0.75\$, the uncertainties are large, and future Euclid data releases are key to confirm these trends.},

	abstract = {Investigating the drivers of the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich spatial and spectral data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, enabling precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework, that combines the average specific star-formation rate (\${\textbackslash}rm sSFR\_{\textbackslash}tau\$) inferred over two timescales (\${\textbackslash}tau=\{10{\textasciicircum}8,10{\textasciicircum}9\}\$ yr), to categorize galaxies as `Ageing' (secularly evolving), `Quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `Retired' (dominated by old stars). We validated this methodology using synthetic observations from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, integrating posterior distributions, and a model-driven method optimizing sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At \$z{\textless}0.1\$ and \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast rsim 3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72\%, 8-17\%, and 14-19\% for Ageing, Quenched, and Retired populations, respectively, consistent with previous studies. The evolution with redshift shows increasing/decreasing fraction of Ageing/Retired galaxies. The fraction of quenched systems shows a weaker dependence on stellar mass and redshift, varying between 5\% and 15\%. We analysed the mass-size-metallicity relation for each population. Ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while Quenched galaxies form an intermediate population, more compact and chemically evolved than Ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe (\$z {\textbackslash}geq 5\$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as \$30 {\textbackslash}\%\$ compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ or H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.},
