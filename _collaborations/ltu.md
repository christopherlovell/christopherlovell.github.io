Learning the Universe (LtU) is a SIMONS Collaboration aiming to rapidly forward model the observable Universe in order to perform Bayesian inference with new Simulation Based Inference techniques.

You can learn more about the collaboration [here](https://learning-the-universe.org/).

I was involved in the development and testing of the LtU-ILI pipeline {% cite 2024OJAp....7E..54H %}, a framework for performing Implicit Likelihood Free inference (or Simulation Based Inference) in astrophysical and cosmological settings.
I also led a recent LtU paper applying synthesizer to the CAMELS simulation, using the LtU-ILI framework to perform cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference {% cite 2024arXiv241113960L %}.
I have also explored the application of normalising flows for generative modelling of galaxy populations {% cite 2023mla..confE..21L %}.
