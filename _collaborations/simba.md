Simba is "a state-of-the-art suite of galaxy formation simulations for exploring the co-evolution of galaxies, black holes, and intergalactic gas within a cosmological context".

The Simba simulations are part of the [CAMELS suite](/collaborations/camels), and have been used to explore a range of questions in the field of galaxy formation and evolution.

I was involved in a project modelling the sub-mm population in Simba using the Powderday code {% cite narayanan_powderday_2021 %}, achieving one of the best matches to observational constraints on the 850-micron number counts in a hydrodynamical simulation to date {% cite lovell_reproducing_2021 %}.
We also explored the orientation dependence of the FIR-mm emission, finding interesting dependencies on the relative inclination {% cite lovell_orientation_2022 %}.

I have also been involved with a number of other Simba projects, modelling dust and cold gas at high-z {% cite lorenzon_tracing_2024 %}, number counts of radio sources {% cite hale_mightee_2022 %}, emission line diagnostics {% cite garg_bpt_2022 %}, circumgalactic medium observations {% cite appleby_mapping_2023 %}, and understanding the efficiency of star formation {% cite ghodsi_star_2024 %}.
