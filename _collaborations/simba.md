Simba is "a state-of-the-art suite of galaxy formation simulations for exploring the co-evolution of galaxies, black holes, and intergalactic gas within a cosmological context".

The Simba simulations are part of the CAMELS suite, and have been used to explore a range of questions in the field of galaxy formation and evolution.

I was involved in a project modelling the sub-mm population in Simba using the Powderday code {% cite 2021ApJS..252...12N %}, achieving one of the best matches to observational constraints on the 850-micron number counts in a hydrodynamical simulation to date {% cite 2021MNRAS.502..772L %}.
We also explored the orientation dependence of the FIR-mm emission, finding interesting dependencies on the relative inclination {% cite 2022MNRAS.515.3644L %}.

I have also been involved with a number of other Simba projects, modelling dust and cold gas at high-z {% cite 2024arXiv240410568L %}, number counts of radio sources {% cite 2023MNRAS.520.2668H %}, emission line diagnostics {% cite 2022ApJ...926...80G %}, circumgalactic medium observations {% cite 2023MNRAS.525.1167A %}, and understanding the efficiency of star formation {% cite 2024MNRAS.528.4393G %}.
