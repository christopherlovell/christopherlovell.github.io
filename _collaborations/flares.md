Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have, in recent years, become capable of matching key distribution functions in the local universe, such as those of stellar mass and star formation rate.
However, high resolution, large volume simulations  have rarely been tested in the high redshift (z > 5) regime, particularly in the most overdense environments.
Creating models that fit both high redshift and low redshift observables self consistently is a significant challenge, but key to understanding the properties of galaxies in the first billion years of the universe's history, and how this affects their latter evolution.
Such models are also necessary to make detailed predictions, and plan observations, for upcoming space based instruments, such as JWST, WFIRST and Euclid.

<a href="https://www.flaresimulations.github.io/" target="source">The First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES)</a> are one approach to these issues.
FLARES consists of a suite of 40 'zoom' simulations using a modified version of the <a href="http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/" target="blank">EAGLE</a> code.
We selected regions at high redshift, with a range of overdensities, from an enormous periodic dark matter-only volume, and resimulated these with full hydrodynamics at fiducial EAGLE resolution.

I led the first release paper {% cite 2021MNRAS.500.2127L %} in which we study predictions for the galaxy stellar mass function, star formation rate function and star-forming sequence as a function of environment.
I also led a paper studying passive galaxy populations in the high redshift (z > 5) regime {% cite 2023MNRAS.525.5520L %}. 
Further work with the FLARES suite is described in {% cite 2021MNRAS.501.3289V 2022MNRAS.511.4999V 2022MNRAS.514.1921R 2023MNRAS.519.3118W 2022MNRAS.517.3227W 2023MNRAS.518..456D 2023MNRAS.518.3935W 2023MNRAS.522.4014W 2023MNRAS.524...43T 2023MNRAS.525.2422S 2023MNRAS.526.6128R 2024MNRAS.527.7337V 2024MNRAS.527.7965W 2024arXiv240402815W 2024arXiv240811037P 2024arXiv241024082M %}
