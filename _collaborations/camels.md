CAMELS is "a project that aims at building bridges between cosmology and astrophysics through numerical simulations and machine learning". You can read more about CAMELS [here](https://www.camel-simulations.org/).

I have worked on producing synthetic photometry for CAMELS galaxies {% cite 2024arXiv241113960L %}.
I also ran the Swift-EAGLE model as part of the suite of simulations (Lovell et al. in prep.).
Below is a video of the evolution of one of the Swift-EAGLE runs, with gas density in blue and gas temperature in red.

I have also been involved in a number of other CAMELS studies, including measurement of the impact of baryons on matter clustering {% cite 2024MNRAS.529.4896G %}, symbolic regression combined with graph neural networks {% cite 2023ApJ...956..149S %} and field level likelihood free inference {% cite 2023ApJ...952...69D 2023arXiv231015234D %}.
